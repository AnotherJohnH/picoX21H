# picoX21H

![picox21h](docs/picoX21H.png)

A hybrid software/hardware simulation of the Yamaha DX21, using a Raspberry Pi Pico, a YM2151 (OPM) sound chip and an I2S DAC.

[Block Diagram](https://github.com/AnotherJohnH/Hardware/blob/main/picoX21H/docs/block_diagram.pdf)

## Status

It's a working musical instrument! Any of the 128 preset patches from the DX21 ROM (v1.5)
can be selected and played via MIDI. Patches starting to sound like the real DX21.

Working...
   + USB MIDI interface (in "peripheral" mode)
   + Physical MIDI interface
   + Basic integration of MIDI ins with the software synth framework
   + YM2151 (OPM) driver
   + PIO-based YM3012 (DAC) interface
   + Captured YM3012 format samples translated to I2S (currently driving a Pimoroni Pico Audio module)
   + 16x2 LCD display
   + Working (but currently noisy) chorus on the Pico's 2nd core (set MIDI CC12 >= 64)

To do...
   + Verify that the YM2151 can accurately replicate the sound of the YM2164, the similar but different chip used in the DX21
   + Complete the implementation of YM2151 register control from all patch parameters
   + Tune and de-noise chorus
   + Try adding a basic reverb on the audio path

## Software

### Checkout

This repo uses git sub-modules, so checkout using --recurse to clone all the
dependent source...

    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/AnotherJohnH/picoX21H.git

ore

    git clone --recurse-submodules ssh://git@github.com/AnotherJohnH/picoX21H.git

### Software dependencies

+ https://github.com/AnotherJohnH/Platform
+ arm-none-eabi-gcc
+ cmake via UNIX make or auto detection of ninja if installed
+ Python3
+ SDL2 (only for native test target)

### Build

Being developed on MacOS but should build on Linux too.

Indirect build for supported targets, rpipico and rpipico2 with cmake and make (or ninja)...

    make

Build a single hardware target e.g. rpipico2 using cmake...

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DPLT_TARGET=rpipico2 -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=Platform/MTL/rpipico2/toolchain.cmake ..
    make
